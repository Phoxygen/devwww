Firefox OS is a commercial product by Mozilla based on the open source Boot to Gecko (B2G) project. It is the first device platform built entirely to open Web standards, with every feature developed as an HTML5 application. Its flexibility, scalability and powerful customization empowers users, developers and industry partners to create customized mobile experiences. It is free from the rules and restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.

As of today, Firefox OS has been launched with local partners in 25 markets across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia. With the upcoming move into the African region, Firefox OS will soon be available on all five continents.


### Firefox OS offers:

- a level playing field against other OS and marketplace providers;
- greater participation in the value chain;
- ownership and control over relationships with customers;
- customized phones that meet the specific needs of various target markets.
